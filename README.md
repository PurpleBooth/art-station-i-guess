# Art Station I Guess

I needed to get some new wallpaper for my desktop so I made this throwaway script to download art from art station automatically rather than manually

I'll probably never use it again.

## Usage

```bash
art-station-i-guess artist-name
```


## Installing

First tap my homebrew repo

``` shell
brew tap PurpleBooth/repo
```

Next install the binary

``` shell
brew install art-station-i-guess
```

You can also download the [latest
release](https://github.com/PurpleBooth/art-station-i-guess/releases/latest)
and run it.
